Build Image Caption Generator using Deep Learning

Image caption generator is a task that involves computer vision and natural language processing concepts to recognize the context of an image and describe them in a natural language like English.

    Image Caption Generator Model (CNN-RNN model) = CNN + LSTM

    CNN – To extract features from the image. A pre-trained model called Xception is used for this.
    LSTM – To generate a description from the extracted information of the image.
